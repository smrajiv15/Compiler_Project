Steps to run the Code Generation Code:
--------------------------------------

1. first build all the executables needed for the Code Generation Compiler project.
   
   Command: bash ./build.sh

   Output: tl_compiler ELF file will be created. 

2. Next, run the exec shell script with the below command.

   Command: bash ./exec.sh <filename.tl>

   Output: Output of the Code Generation code will be a list of files as below:

		1. <basename>.tok file get the output of the scanner phase i.e list of tokens. In case of any Error in the
		   program, error messages will be redirected in to this file.
		2. AST.dot file for visualizing the Annotated Abstract Syntax Tree. Corresponding PNG file is automatically
		   created after that.
                3. Control_Flow.dot file helps us in visualizing the control flow of the program corresponding to each of the
		   block.Corresponding PNG file of the control flow graph will be created after the succesfull Compilation of the
		   program.
		4. Assembly_Code.s file is created. Which contains the assembly instructions to execute in the MIPS simulator.
 
           All these output files will be stored in the current working directory i.e. "workdir".

   NOTE: The tl file given while running the exec script should be in the present working directory for properly creating the .tok
	 and the PNG files.
